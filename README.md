## Park Pal:
Park Pal is a full-stack web application that allows for users to track ride waiting times while going through a specific theme park. There are several parks a user can add on thier account to see its ride wait times. Not only that, but users can also create a trip where they can add certain rides they want to ride during that trip.

## My Part: Lead API
This application has basic functioning of searching, deleting, adding, and updating. I worked on all these basic functions for the webite and mobile app using _JavaScript_ and _MongoDB_ commands to connect to our database. All APIs can be found in `server.js` and its documentation was done on SwaggerHub for organization and to make it easier for frontend to determine the input and return values of each API. I also used unit testing in _Jest_ to test a few APIs, as a requirnment for the project, and they all successfully passed. The code to this can be found in `tests\server.test.js`.

## Api Documentation:
This documentation was constantly updated as I was building the APIs.
